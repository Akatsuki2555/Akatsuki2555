## Hello, it is mldkyt.

Hello, I'm mldkyt! I'm a trans catgirl who enjoys making a variety of content. I make My Summer Car mods though I don't identify as a My Summer Car modder. I make a variety of other projects that include Akabot, a Discord bot by me, Astolfo Forge Mod, which adds a bunch of femboys into Minecraft or Astolfo is coming for you, which is a windows program where Astolfo comes to you to call you a great human being. I sometimes also make YouTube videos featuring my projects, mods, successes, tutorials and other content.

I have a [website with my projects](https://mldkyt.com/). Explore them by clicking `Projects` at the top and scrolling through the page. Explore my social accounts by clicking `Socials` on the top of the page. Explore slightly different pieces of work by clicking `Miscellaneous` on the top of the page.

I am on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@mldkyt), [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mldkyt), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/mldkyt) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@mldkyt).

If you are searching for my My Summer Car mods, I have quit. The MSC community is way too toxic for me to support it with mods. Bigger modders attack smaller modders with violating the NexusMods rules in order to just take down smaller modders. Those bigger modders then end up with half the kudos on NexusMods than the smaller modders which have continuously added nice content into the game. Furthermore, the Discord server for modding is filled with people who don’t understand basic things like username changes, modders supporting modders and so on. People will outright think that if I help another mod creator with their mod, that the mod is mine, because I helped them. This is wildly incorrect as it says “helping coding” and not “writing the mod for me” in the mod description. If you want to install my mods, you have to compile them from source, the instructions for that should be under every mod. You are free to release the mods on any site you want as long as you give me the credit to do so for other people to download my mods. You can contribute by forking my repositories and working on them. You can hate me all you want for this, but this is my choice, I am working on things I love to do more and things that bring me more value, like recent Celeste videos on my YouTube channel which have blown up within a week.

EDIT 1: All of the mods are now available for download from GitHub because of demand. You can now download them without the need to compile them from source code and also they are now unarchived so if you have programming experience, you can contribute to the mods.

EDIT 2: The mods will get deleted soon. Now it's your time to archive them.
