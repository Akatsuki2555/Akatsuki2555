Hello, I'm mldkyt! I'm a trans catgirl who enjoys making a variety of content. I make My Summer Car mods though I don't identify as a My Summer Car modder. I make a variety of other projects that include Akabot, a Discord bot by me, Astolfo Forge Mod, which adds a bunch of femboys into Minecraft or Astolfo is coming for you, which is a windows program where Astolfo comes to you to call you a great human being. I sometimes also make YouTube videos featuring my projects, mods, successes, tutorials and other content.

I have a [website with my projects](https://mldkyt.com/). Explore them by clicking `Projects` at the top and scrolling through the page. Explore my social accounts by clicking `Socials` on the top of the page. Explore slightly different pieces of work by clicking `Miscellaneous` on the top of the page.
